## Release 1.0.10

Date: `2024-09-18`

### Changes

* Added `precip_type_text` sensor, which describes what type of precipitation is measured. (No Rain, Rain or Heavy Rain/Hail). **NOTE** Except for danish the text needs translation for the other languages. Please submit a pull request if you can translate the text.


## Release 1.0.9

Date: `2024-05-04`

### Changes

- Changed rain sensor state class to TOTAL_INCREASING, to better support statiscal sensors.

## Release 1.0.8

Date: `2024-01-27`

### Changes

- Added option to adjust number of hours returned in the hourly forecast. Min is 12 hours and maximum is 96 hours. Default is 48 hours. Closing [#74](https://github.com/briis/weatherflow_forecast/issues/74)
- As a result of this, text in the config form needs more translation for certain languages.
- Bumped dependency pyweatherflow-forecast to 1.0.11

## Release 1.0.7

Date: `2024-01-22`

### Changes

- Even though the Station has not transmitted data to WeatherFlow, the device itself, often does, so we are able to post the Voltage, Battery and Power Save Mode from the device itself.
- New binary sensor `Data Available` is added to the system. If WeatherFlow reports an empty dataset, this is set to False, and you should check your hub and see if it is still online.
- Added better error handling if user types in the wrong Station ID upon configuration. The error is now trapped, and a more detailed error message supplied.
- Bump dependency module pyweatherflow-forecast to 1.0.10


## Release 1.0.6

Date: `2024-01-20`

### Changes

This release is all about error handling. Most issues I get reported are caused by the station being offline for some reason or the sensors not reporting correctly. These two are, of course, sometimes related, but often the missing update of sensor data is caused by the Tempest device being underpowered. For a person like myself who live in the Northern Hemisphere, this always happens in the winther when there is not enough daylight to charge the battery. So after sometime the device will reduce the reporting intervals and the sensors it reports, until the time when the power is so low that it stops sending any data.

- As of this release the system will write a warning to the logfile if it detects that there is no data. It will continue working, but there will be no data in the sensors until the station comes back online.
- Also at the time of setup, if you try to add the sensors, an error will be shown if there are no sensor data, and you cannot add the sensors until the issue is resolved. The forecast can always be added.
- Finally, if you discover that sensor data is not being updated or only some of them, check the `power_save_mode` sensor. Any number here greater than 0 will mean reduced updating of sensors. You can read more about the Power Save Mode [here](https://help.weatherflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048877194-Solar-Power-Rechargeable-Battery)
- Bump dependency pyweatherflow-forecast to 1.0.8 (Failed setup, will retry #70 and Error while setting up weatherflow_forecast platform for sensor #69)


## Release 1.0.5

Date: `2024-01-06`

### Changes

- Fixing issue [#59](https://github.com/briis/weatherflow_forecast/issues/59). As I could not find a way to provoke the error, I cannot fully guarantee that this fix will work. If not please open a new issue with detailed logfiles.

## Release 1.0.4

Date: `2024-01-04`

### Changes

- This integration is now part of the Default HACS store. So you can delete the pointer to the Github library under *Custom Repositories*
- Added `wind_gust_speed` to daily forecast, closing [#58](https://github.com/briis/weatherflow_forecast/issues/58)


## Release 1.0.3

Date: `2023-12-23`

### Changes

- If sensors have been installed, and the user selectes to remove them again, ensure they are deleted from Home Assistant.
- Added new sensor `Precip Type` exposing an integer with the type of precipitation. Possible values are: 0 = none, 1 = rain, 2 = hail and 3 = rain+hail (Experimental)

## Release 1.0.2

Date: `2023-12-16`

### Changes

- @baylanger updated the French Translation.

## Release 1.0.1

Date: `2023-12-03`

This release is now V1.0, as all the relevant entities from the previous release are now implemented. Unfortunately my PR for getting this in to Default HACS is not merged yet, but I hope that this will happen soon, and when this does the previous integration will be removed.

### Changes

- @zuper83 updated the Swedish Translation.
- Added new sensor `Precip Intensity` that express the intensity of rain in text. (Can be translated). Closing [#41](https://github.com/briis/weatherflow_forecast/issues/41)
- Fixing wrong value and unit for the `Air Density` sensor when using the Imperial Unit System. **WARNING** When digging in to this, the Unit for the Metric system was also wrong and is changed from µg/m³ to kg/m³. You can correct the unit under the _Developer Tools_ and then _STATISTICS_ if you get a warning during startup. Closing #40


## Release 1.0.0

Date: `2023-11-18`

This release is now V1.0, as all the relevant entities from the previous release are now implemented. Unfortunately my PR for getting this in to Default HACS is not merged yet, but I hope that this will happen soon, and when this does the previous integration will be removed.

Date: `2023-10-14`

### Changes
- **BREAKING**
  **Due to all the changes made in this release, I recommend that you remove the integration and re-add it. This will ensure all sensors are named correctly, and obsolete sensors are removed.**
  - Precipitation Minutes... sensors have been renamed. Please delete them manually if you do not follow the recommendation above.
  - Wet Bulb sensors have been renamed due to spelling error. You might need to delete the obsolete sensors manually.
- Changed icon for Cloud Base
- Add the Integration to the Default HACS store. (Not merged on release of this version)
- Bump pyweatherflow-forecast to 0.6.0
- Added `Voltage` sensor. This sensor will only be available for Tempest devices. There will be no implementation for AIR and SKY as these are deprecated devices.
- Added `Battery` sensor. This sensor is derived from the Voltage sensor above and shows the % full based on voltage amount.
